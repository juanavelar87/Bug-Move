# Bug-Move
The project was supposed to be a web page that could help everyone know what kind of species or insects there are in their location at that moment. Not only that but also present to them the possible future of the species based on temperature, precipitations and other factors. 
It was supposed the challenge by showing everyone the species that were in their zone and the states they are. If they are in risk or are a invasive specie in that area.
